# csedge-task-1
This repository contains a facial recognition system built with Python and the dlib library. The project is an improvement upon a previous implementation and uses the dlib library for facial recognition and the OpenCV library for webcam and video processing. The dlib library provides a pre-trained neural network for face detection
